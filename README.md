# E-Commerce Deep Dive: Amazon Sales Performance  

## Project Overview  
This project is about analyzing Amazon sales data to understand sales performance, customer preferences, and inventory management.  
I wanted to explore the trends in orders, categories, shipping methods, and regions, and come up with insights that could actually be useful for improving business decisions.

## Business Impact  
The analysis can help in:  
- Creating a better customer experience  
- Increasing revenue by identifying peak months and products  
- Reducing costs by stocking the right items in the right amounts  
- Staying competitive by using data to adapt quickly

## Dataset  
- File: AmazonSalesReport.csv  
- Size: 129,000 rows × 21 columns  
- Source: Kaggle  

Some of the main columns: `Order ID`, `Amount`, `Date`, `Status`, `Qty`, `Category`, `Ship City`, `Ship Service Level`

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- SQL  
- Looker Studio (for dashboards)  

---

## Steps I Took  
1. Cleaned and standardized the data (removed duplicates, filled nulls, fixed data types)  
2. Explored the data with Python and SQL  
3. Looked for trends in sales, categories, and shipping methods  
4. Built an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio  

---

## Key Insights  
- April had the highest revenue and number of orders  
- Shirts and T-shirts were the top-selling categories (~70K orders)  
- Sizes M, L, and XL were the most popular  
- 71.5% of customers went for expedited shipping  
- Around 5,000 orders were cancelled  

---

## Dashboard  
I built a dashboard in Looker Studio with 3 main parts:  
- Sales analysis  
- Customer preferences  
- Inventory management  

---

## Conclusion & Future Work  
This project showed me how much impact data can have in e-commerce.  
Some of my recommendations:  
- Focus inventory on best-selling products and popular sizes  
- Improve shipping services (especially expedited)  
- Plan for seasonal demand (like the April spike)  

In the future, I’d like to extend this by adding predictive models for sales forecasting and including customer demographics in the analysis.
